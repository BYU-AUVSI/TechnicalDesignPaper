\section{System Design}

% This section of the paper describes the design of the UAS system. For each system, the paper should describe what was chosen or built, why it was chosen, and what implications it has for task performance. This section should also describe tests which were conducted on each component and provide data on performance. If a team elects not to include certain elements (e.g. air drop), it should be so stated in the appropriate section.
