\subsection{Design Rationale}

% This section should start with the environmental factors (e.g. team qualifications, budget, etc.) and mission requirements (e.g. tasks, point system, etc.), and describe the flow of decisions which led to the final design. For example, how the object task influences camera choice which influences aircraft choice which influences autopilot choice. It should describe the tradeoffs of design options and the rationale for the final solution. For example, for a fixed-wing aircraft what are the high-level tradeoffs between a high-wing and low-wing design.
